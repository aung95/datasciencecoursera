To do swirl : 
# to start test type swirl() - to exit press bye()
# | When you are at the R prompt (>):
#   | -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
# | -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore what you do...
# | -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
# | -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
# | -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
# | -- Typing info() displays these options again.
